# Install Kairos on Kubernetes with Helm

Get a Kairos 0.8.1 deployment serving on a cluster you already run.

**Before you start**, have all four:

- A cluster and Helm 3.8 or newer (the chart is distributed as an OCI artifact).
- **A PostgreSQL the cluster can reach, with `pgvector` available.** The
  extension is a requirement, not an option: the first migration installs it, and
  a database that cannot is refused at startup with a message saying so. Managed
  Postgres offers pgvector on RDS, Cloud SQL and Azure; `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`
  is the upstream image with it added.

  If you are only trying Kairos out, you can skip this: the chart will stand a
  Postgres up for you. See [Trying it out without a
  database](#trying-it-out-without-a-database) — and do not use it for anything
  real.
- **An OIDC issuer with Kairos registered as an app.** The chart bundles no
  identity provider. If you have not registered the clients yet, do
  [Configure an OIDC issuer](configure-an-oidc-issuer.md) first — you need the
  issuer URL and audience before the chart will render.
- Your own OIDC `sub`, which becomes the deployment admin that provisions the
  first tenant.

Every value named below is specified in
[Configuration → Helm chart values](../reference/configuration.md#helm-chart-values).

## 1. Choose the tenancy mode

Set **exactly one** of these, and the choice drives DNS and TLS:

| Use | Set | Ingress | You need |
|---|---|---|---|
| One organization per host | `config.tenancy.baseDomain: kairos.example` — `acme.kairos.example` resolves to tenant `acme` | `ingress.tenancyMode: wildcard` routes the apex and `*.kairos.example` | Wildcard DNS and a wildcard certificate |
| A single organization | `config.tenancy.singleTenant: acme` | `ingress.tenancyMode: single` routes `ingress.host` | One A/AAAA record and one certificate |

Setting neither fails the render, and so does setting both:

```text
Error: execution error at (kairos/templates/deployment.yaml:1:4): config.tenancy:
set EXACTLY ONE of baseDomain (wildcard subdomain tenancy) or singleTenant
(single-tenant mode) — neither is set.
```

In wildcard mode, create the wildcard DNS record and issue the wildcard
certificate now — a DNS-01 cert-manager issuer, or a Secret you provide. The
rollout in step 4 will succeed without them and be unreachable.

## 2. Write a values file

Keep the database URL out of values by creating the Secret yourself:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic kairos-db \
  --from-literal=DATABASE_URL='postgres://kairos:PASSWORD@my-postgres:5432/kairos'
```

```yaml
# my-values.yaml
database:
  existingSecret: kairos-db          # the chart renders no Secret of its own
config:
  oidc:
    issuerUrl: "https://idp.example.com/"
    audience: "kairos"
  tenancy:
    baseDomain: "kairos.example"
  deploymentAdmins: "oidc-sub-of-the-first-admin"
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: nginx
  tenancyMode: wildcard
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  tls:
    enabled: true
    secretName: kairos-tls
```

For an evaluation install, `database.url` inline and `config.tenancy.singleTenant`
are enough, and `ingress.enabled` can stay `false`.

Three values are load-bearing and the chart refuses to render without them —
each failure names itself, so you will not get a half-configured Deployment:

- `config.oidc.issuerUrl` — `config.oidc.issuerUrl is required (KAIROS-A-0016:
  bring your own OIDC issuer)`
- `config.oidc.audience` — the same, for the audience
- one of `database.url` / `database.existingSecret` — `database: set EITHER
  database.url (inline) OR database.existingSecret`

Then apply whichever of these describe your deployment:

- **Your issuer mints a distinct `aud` per OAuth client** (notably Google
  Workspace): make `config.oidc.audience` a YAML list of the client ids. A
  token matching any listed audience validates; there is no "any audience"
  mode.
- **Your GUI client is confidential** (again Google Workspace): set
  `config.webClientSecretExistingSecret` rather than `config.webClientSecret`,
  so the secret stays out of values and release history.
- **Your issuer's access token is opaque:** set `config.apiBearer: id_token`.
- **You front Kairos with your own gateway:** leave `ingress.enabled: false`
  and route to the Service yourself.
- **You want `KAIROS_PUBLIC_URL` or `KAIROS_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY`** (needed for
  [Connect a git forge](connect-a-git-forge.md)): neither has a dedicated chart
  value. Set them through `extraEnv`.
- **You scrape with the Prometheus Operator:** set
  `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled: true`, which scrapes `/metrics`. Liveness
  probes go at `/healthz`, readiness at `/readyz`; the chart wires both already.

Leave `image.tag` empty so it tracks the chart's `appVersion`. Do not pin
`latest`; the chart never resolves it. Leave `config.devUi` at `false` — it
mounts the Swagger UI at `/api/docs`.

## 3. Install

```sh
helm install kairos oci://ghcr.io/colliery-io/charts/kairos \
  --version 0.8.1 -f my-values.yaml
```

`--version` is not optional in practice: the chart publishes no floating tag.

## 4. Wait for the rollout

```sh
kubectl rollout status deploy/kairos
```

The container applies pending **public** migrations on boot, before it binds,
so there is no migration Job to run and no ordering for you to arrange. While
they are outstanding `/readyz` answers 503 with `not ready: pending database
migrations`.

The startup probe covers that window. If a first boot against a large database
outlasts it, the pod is killed before it ever reports ready — raise
`startupProbe.failureThreshold`
([Probes](../reference/configuration.md#probes)).

## 5. Confirm the release

```sh
helm test kairos          # runs a Pod that curls /healthz
```

## 6. Provision the first tenant

A fresh install has no organizations. Log in through your issuer, then follow
[Provision a tenant](provision-a-tenant.md) — the `config.deploymentAdmins`
value from step 2 is what grants you the cross-tenant admin routes.

## Upgrading and rolling back

```sh
helm upgrade kairos oci://ghcr.io/colliery-io/charts/kairos \
  --version <new> -f my-values.yaml
helm rollback kairos
```

`helm rollback` rolls the process back, not the database: migrations are
forward-only. Take a dump before every upgrade, and roll the database back with
it — see [Back up and restore](back-up-and-restore.md).

Before it serves, the server applies the new public migrations and the new
tenant migrations of each organization. An upgrade thus needs no migration
step. The replicas take turns: a database lock lets one migrate at a
time. A failed migration of one organization does not stop
the server. That organization answers 503 `TENANT_NOT_READY`, and the server
log has the error. Repair the
schema and run `kubectl exec deploy/kairos -- kairos-server migrate-tenants`;
the organization serves again within 30 seconds.

## Trying it out without a database

`helm install` with nothing but the two OIDC values works, because the chart
stands a PostgreSQL up inside the release:

```sh
helm install kairos oci://ghcr.io/colliery-io/charts/kairos \
  -n kairos --create-namespace \
  --set config.oidc.issuerUrl=https://idp.example.com/ \
  --set config.oidc.audience=kairos \
  --set config.tenancy.singleTenant=demo
```

That exists because Kairos requires `pgvector`, and asking someone to find a
Postgres with a particular extension before they can see the product is a poor
first afternoon.

**Do not run it in production.** One replica, one PVC, no backups, no failover,
and a password that sits in your values and your release history. When you are
past evaluating, turn it off and point at a managed instance:

```yaml
postgresql:
  enabled: false
database:
  url: "postgres://kairos:PASSWORD@my-postgres:5432/kairos"
```

You do not have to remember to do both. `postgresql.enabled` is **unset** by
default, which means *on unless you name a database* — so adding `database.url`
is enough, and every release that already exists keeps the database it has
through an upgrade without any edit. Setting `postgresql.enabled: true` *and* a
`database.url` is refused when the chart renders, because that is asking for two
databases and picking one for you would either abandon yours or quietly stand a
second up beside it.

## Evaluating without an identity provider

Kairos requires an OIDC issuer, which for an evaluator means running Dex by hand or
standing up a cloud OAuth client before seeing the product at all. So the chart can
stand a Dex up inside the release, the same way it can stand up a PostgreSQL.

You need three things: an ingress, an email, and a bcrypt hash.

```sh
# The chart ships NO default password. Generate one — nothing to install:
HASH=$(docker run --rm httpd:2.4 htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" 'your-password' | tr -d ':\n')

helm install kairos oci://ghcr.io/colliery-io/charts/kairos \
  -n kairos --create-namespace \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.tenancyMode=single \
  --set ingress.host=kairos.example.com \
  --set config.tenancy.singleTenant=demo \
  --set dex.adminEmail=you@example.com \
  --set-string dex.adminPasswordHash="$HASH"
```

No `config.oidc.issuerUrl` and no `config.oidc.audience`: both are derived from the
bundled Dex. You get a PostgreSQL too, since naming neither gets you both.

**Do not run it in production, and mean it more than you did for the database.** One
replica, **in-memory storage — so every restart rotates the signing keys and
invalidates every token in flight** — one static user, and a password hash in your
values and your release history. There is no user lifecycle, no password reset, no
MFA, and no audit trail. Point `config.oidc.issuerUrl` at a real issuer before
anybody who is not you logs in:

```yaml
config:
  oidc:
    issuerUrl: https://idp.example.com/
    audience: kairos
```

As with the database you do not have to remember to turn the bundle off.
`dex.enabled` is **unset** by default, meaning *on unless you name an issuer* — so
adding `issuerUrl` is enough, and every release that already exists keeps its issuer
through an upgrade without any edit. Setting `dex.enabled: true` *and* an
`issuerUrl` is refused at render time, because that is asking for two issuers.

### Why this one needs an ingress

The bundled PostgreSQL does not, and the difference is worth understanding rather
than working around.

An OIDC issuer URL is not just an address to fetch from — it is an **identity**. Dex
stamps it into the `iss` claim of every token it mints, and Kairos rejects a token
whose `iss` is not the issuer it was configured with. So the URL has to be the same
string in two places that see the cluster differently: the browser being redirected
to log in, and the server validating the token afterwards.

An in-cluster Service name like `http://kairos-dex:5556/dex` cannot be that string,
because a browser cannot resolve it. So the chart routes Dex at `/dex` on your
ingress and uses that public URL for both sides. The server then reaches its own
issuer by hairpinning out through the ingress and back — which works, and is another
reason this is for evaluation rather than production.

If TLS is not enabled on the ingress the issuer is `http://`, which browsers
increasingly dislike for a login form. Enable `ingress.tls` for anything beyond a
first look.

## Using a hosted embedding model

Retrieval works out of the box: the model ships inside the image and needs no
configuration. To use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead:

```yaml
embeddings:
  url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  model: "text-embedding-3-small"
  existingSecret: "kairos-embed"      # holding KAIROS_EMBED_API_KEY
```

The key follows the same pattern as `database.url` — inline as `embeddings.apiKey`
or from a Secret you already keep. A local Ollama needs no key at all. Setting
`embeddings.provider: none` turns embeddings off entirely; search still works,
from text alone.
