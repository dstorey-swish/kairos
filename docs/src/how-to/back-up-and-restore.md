# Back up a deployment, and restore it

Take a backup you can actually restore from, and restore from it.

**Before you start:**

- `psql` / `pg_dump` access to the deployment's PostgreSQL, at a version at least
  as new as the server's.
- Back up exactly two things, and nothing else: **the database** — `public` plus
  every `org_<slug>` schema, in one dump — and **the deployment secrets that live
  outside it**: `DATABASE_URL`, `KAIROS_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY`,
  `KAIROS_SECRETS_KEY`, `KAIROS_WEB_CLIENT_SECRET`, plus database roles if you
  manage them in the cluster. There is nothing on the pods to capture: the image is stateless and
  the chart mounts no volume.
- Keep `KAIROS_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY` with the database password. Losing it is not
  data loss but it is an outage — every forge connection has to be rotated and
  re-pasted in the forge.
- Keep `KAIROS_SECRETS_KEY` with the database password too. The database holds
  the read tokens of the repositories, encrypted with this key. Without the
  key, you must set each read token again.

## 1. Dump the database

A single database-wide dump captures every tenant, because tenants are schemas
inside it:

```sh
pg_dump --format=custom --compress=9 \
  --dbname="$DATABASE_URL" \
  --file="kairos-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).dump"
```

Do not dump schema-by-schema. `public` holds the organization rows, users,
service accounts and API-key hashes that every `org_*` schema refers to; a
per-tenant dump restores to a tenant nobody can log in to.

If cluster roles are yours to manage:

```sh
pg_dumpall --roles-only > kairos-roles.sql
```

## 2. Check the dump is a dump

```sh
pg_restore --list kairos-….dump | grep -c 'SCHEMA - org_'
```

The count should equal your tenant count — compare with
`kairos admin tenants list`. A dump that lists no `org_*` schemas was taken
against the wrong database.

## 3. Schedule it

Kairos imposes nothing here. Whatever your organization already does for
Postgres — a `CronJob` running the command above, your provider's automated
snapshots, WAL archiving with point-in-time recovery — applies unchanged.
Kairos's own guidance is only the two things above: the whole database, and the
secrets alongside it.

### The compose deployment has a schedule

The compose deployment has a service with the name `postgres-backup`. It makes
the dump of step 1, and it does the check of step 2.

The service makes a dump when it starts. Then it makes a dump at each interval.
It keeps the newest dumps and removes the others.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KAIROS_BACKUP_DIR` | `./backups` | The directory on the host that gets the dumps. |
| `KAIROS_BACKUP_INTERVAL` | `21600` | The seconds between two dumps. The default is 6 hours. |
| `KAIROS_BACKUP_KEEP` | `4` | The number of dumps that the service keeps. |

Set `KAIROS_BACKUP_DIR` to a directory on a different disk from the Docker
volumes. A disk failure then does not remove the database and its backups
together.

To see the result of the last dump, read the log of the service:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yaml --env-file deploy/.env logs --tail 5 postgres-backup
```

The line `backup ok` gives the file and its size. A dump that fails leaves no
file, and it removes no old dump.

The service does not copy the secrets of the deployment. Keep a copy of
`deploy/.env` in a different location.

## Restore

Four steps, in this order.

### Stop the servers

```sh
kubectl scale deploy/kairos --replicas=0
```

Restoring under a live server means a schema changing beneath open connections.

### Restore into an empty database

```sh
createdb kairos_restored
pg_restore --dbname=kairos_restored --no-owner --clean --if-exists kairos-….dump
```

Restore into a fresh database rather than over the existing one, so a failed
restore leaves you somewhere to go back to.

### Point Kairos at it and bring it up

Update `DATABASE_URL` (the Secret, then `helm upgrade`), then scale back up.
On boot, before it binds, the server applies the new **public** migrations.
Then it applies the new **tenant** migrations of each organization. That is how a dump
from an older release comes forward, and it is why there is no migration Job to
run. Replicas that start together take turns: a database lock lets one migrate
at a time.

### Check the organizations

The server log has one line for each organization. A failed migration of one
organization does not stop the server. The server starts, and that organization
answers each request with 503 `TENANT_NOT_READY`. The log line has
the error. Repair the schema, then run:

```sh
kubectl exec deploy/kairos -- kairos-server migrate-tenants
```

The organization serves again within 30 seconds, with no restart.

### Verify

```sh
curl -fsS https://<host>/readyz          # ready
kairos admin tenants list                 # every tenant, with schema_exists true
kairos boards list --tenant <slug>        # one tenant's boards actually answer
```

Restore **forward or level, never backward**: the dump's schema must be the
binary's version or older. Migrations are forward-only — there is no `revert`
subcommand — so an older image against a database a newer release has already
migrated is not a supported configuration, and `/readyz` will not catch it.
When you roll an image back, roll the database back to a dump taken before the
upgrade.

## Size for unbounded growth

**Nothing prunes anything in 0.8.1.** The five retention variables are inert —
setting `KAIROS_RETENTION_MODE`, `KAIROS_ARCHIVE_TARGET` or any of the windows
has no effect, and configuring an archive target will not reclaim a byte
([Configuration → Retention: recognised but
inert](../reference/configuration.md#retention--recognised-but-inert)).
Archiving work does not reclaim anything either — it is a soft delete
([Archiving](../explanation/archiving.md)).

So plan for it: `item_history` grows by a row per edit and `activity_log` by a
row per write, forever, and your dumps grow with them. Size the volume and the
backup window against the deployment's lifetime to date, and alarm on the growth
rate rather than on a threshold.
