# Deploy Kairos to Kubernetes

In this tutorial we will run Kairos on a Kubernetes cluster from the published
chart and image, with a database and an identity provider beside it. By the end
you will have a deployment answering `/healthz` and `/readyz` and serving the
interface, and you will have seen what Kairos needs from a cluster and what it
brings itself.

It takes about twenty minutes, most of which is waiting for images to pull.

## Before we start

You will need:

- **Docker**, running.
- **[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)** — we will create a throwaway cluster
  and delete it at the end.
- **kubectl** and **Helm 3.8 or newer** (the chart is published as an OCI
  artifact, which older Helm cannot pull).

We use kind because this is a lesson, not a production deployment. Everything
here works the same on a real cluster; the database and identity provider are
the parts you would replace.

Identity is always yours, and so is state by default. The chart can stand an
evaluation PostgreSQL up inside the release, but this lesson brings its own so
you see the shape you would actually run. So the first two things we install are
a throwaway Postgres and a throwaway Dex, pinned to exact versions so this
lesson behaves the same every time. **Neither is suitable for anything but a
tutorial**: no persistence, no backups, one hard-coded password.

The Postgres image is `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` rather than `postgres:16`: the
same upstream Postgres with the `pgvector` extension added. Kairos **requires**
it — the extension backs semantic retrieval, and the first migration installs
it, so a plain `postgres:16` fails to migrate rather than merely doing without
the feature. Managed Postgres offers pgvector on RDS, Cloud SQL and Azure, so
this is not a reason to stop bringing your own.

## Create the cluster

```sh
kind create cluster --name kairos-tutorial --wait 120s
kubectl create namespace kairos
```

You should see kind report the cluster ready and `namespace/kairos created`.

## Install a throwaway database

```sh
kubectl -n kairos create deployment postgres --image=pgvector/pgvector:pg16 --port=5432
kubectl -n kairos set env deployment/postgres \
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=kairos POSTGRES_USER=kairos POSTGRES_DB=kairos
kubectl -n kairos expose deployment postgres --port=5432
kubectl -n kairos rollout status deployment/postgres --timeout=240s
```

```
deployment "postgres" successfully rolled out
```

## Install a throwaway identity provider

Save this as `dex.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: dex
  namespace: kairos
data:
  config.yaml: |
    issuer: http://dex.kairos.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex
    storage:
      type: memory
    web:
      http: 0.0.0.0:5556
    oauth2:
      skipApprovalScreen: true
    staticClients:
      - id: kairos-web
        name: Kairos Web GUI
        public: true
        redirectURIs:
          - http://localhost:8080/callback
    enablePasswordDB: true
    staticPasswords:
      - email: admin@example.com
        # bcrypt of "admin-password"
        hash: "$2y$10$2b2cU8CPhOTaGrs1HRQuAueS7JTT5ZHsHSzYiFPm1leZck7Mc8T4W"
        username: admin
        userID: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dex
  namespace: kairos
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector: { matchLabels: { app: dex } }
  template:
    metadata: { labels: { app: dex } }
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: dex
          image: ghcr.io/dexidp/dex:v2.41.1
          args: ["dex", "serve", "/etc/dex/config.yaml"]
          ports: [{ containerPort: 5556 }]
          volumeMounts:
            - { name: config, mountPath: /etc/dex }
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap: { name: dex }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dex
  namespace: kairos
spec:
  selector: { app: dex }
  ports: [{ port: 5556, targetPort: 5556 }]
```

Apply it and wait:

```sh
kubectl apply -f dex.yaml
kubectl -n kairos rollout status deployment/dex --timeout=240s
```

```
deployment "dex" successfully rolled out
```

## Install Kairos

Save this as `values.yaml`:

```yaml
database:
  url: "postgres://kairos:kairos@postgres.kairos.svc.cluster.local:5432/kairos"
config:
  oidc:
    issuerUrl: "http://dex.kairos.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex"
    audience: "kairos-web"
  tenancy:
    singleTenant: "demo"
```

Those three are the minimum. The chart refuses to render without the two OIDC
values, which is deliberate — a deployment that cannot say who its users are is
not a deployment.

```sh
helm install kairos oci://ghcr.io/colliery-io/charts/kairos --version 0.8.1 \
  -n kairos -f values.yaml --wait --timeout 6m
```

Helm pulls the chart from the registry, then the cluster pulls the image:

```
Pulled: ghcr.io/colliery-io/charts/kairos:0.8.1
NAME: kairos
STATUS: deployed
```

The container applies its own database migrations on boot, so there is no
separate migrate step.

## Check it is running

```sh
kubectl -n kairos get pods
```

Both Kairos replicas should be `1/1 Running`, alongside Postgres and Dex:

```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dex-6d556d5f6d-nh6ww        1/1     Running   0          3m
kairos-5785ff87b8-52d9d     1/1     Running   0          1m
kairos-5785ff87b8-7nqvk     1/1     Running   0          1m
postgres-6f59b65747-djxn8   1/1     Running   0          3m
```

## Reach it

```sh
kubectl -n kairos port-forward svc/kairos 8080:80
```

Leave that running, and in another terminal:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl http://localhost:8080/readyz
```

```
ok
ready
```

Those two answer different questions, and the difference matters when you
deploy for real. `/healthz` says the process is alive. `/readyz` says it can
reach its database — which is what Kubernetes should gate traffic on.

Now open <http://localhost:8080>. Kairos serves the interface from the same
process, and you will be sent to Dex to sign in as `admin@example.com` /
`admin-password`.

The tenant is empty: this is a fresh deployment, not the demo data from
[Run Kairos locally](run-kairos-locally.md). An empty Kairos is the honest
starting point for a real one.

## Clean up

```sh
kind delete cluster --name kairos-tutorial
```

That removes the cluster and everything in it, including the database.

## What you have seen

Kairos is one stateless image. It brought the interface, the API, MCP and SCIM
in a single process, and it needed exactly two things from you: somewhere to
keep state, and somebody to say who users are — a Postgres, which later versions
need `pgvector` on, and an OIDC issuer.

That is the whole deployment story, and the rest is making those two things
production-grade rather than throwaway.

## Where to go next

- [Install with Helm](../how-to/install-with-helm.md) — the values a real
  deployment sets, and what each one does
- [Configure an OIDC issuer](../how-to/configure-an-oidc-issuer.md) — replacing
  the throwaway Dex with your own
- [Provision a tenant](../how-to/provision-a-tenant.md) — this lesson pinned a
  single tenant; a real deployment may host several
- [Back up and restore](../how-to/back-up-and-restore.md) — the database is the
  only state, and that guide says what to do about it
